# 502 Error - ROOT CAUSE FOUND âœ…

## The Real Problem

Your **Docker build is failing** during `pip install`, not a runtime issue!

**Evidence from logs:**
```
#10 9.343 Downloading language_data-1.3.0-py3-none-any.whl (5.4 MB)
Deployment failed. Removing the new version of your application.
```

The build was downloading dependencies and **timed out** before completing. No container was created, hence the 502 error.

---

## Fix Applied âœ…

### 1. **Optimized Dockerfile**
- âœ… Split `pip install` into multiple groups
- âœ… Added `--timeout=300` (5 min timeout per package)
- âœ… Added `--retries=5` (auto-retry on network failure)
- âœ… Install heavy packages (spaCy) separately

### 2. **Added `.dockerignore`**
- âœ… Exclude unnecessary files (tests, docs, .git)
- âœ… Faster build with smaller context

### 3. **Created Alternative Dockerfile**
- âœ… `Dockerfile.optimized` with even more granular installation
- âœ… Use if main Dockerfile still fails

## What to Do Now

### Step 1: Redeploy in Coolify

Changes are pushed to GitHub. Now redeploy:

1. **Go to Coolify Dashboard**
2. **Click "Redeploy"** (or wait for auto-deploy if enabled)
3. **Watch Build Logs** closely

### Step 2: Monitor Build Progress

Watch for these successful steps:

```
Step 7/15 : RUN pip install ... fastapi uvicorn ...
Successfully installed fastapi-0.104.1 uvicorn-0.24.0

Step 8/15 : RUN pip install ... sqlalchemy ...
Successfully installed sqlalchemy-2.0.23

# ... continue through all package groups ...

Step 11/15 : RUN pip install ... spacy==3.7.2
Successfully installed spacy-3.7.2

Step 12/15 : RUN pip install ... en_core_web_sm ...
Successfully installed en-core-web-sm-3.7.1
```

### Step 3: Verify Success

**If build succeeds:**
```powershell
# Test health endpoint
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://promopack-extractor.powellmatt.com/health" -UseBasicParsing
```

**Expected:** `StatusCode: 200` âœ…

**If you get 200:** Problem solved! ðŸŽ‰

## If Build Still Fails

### Option A: Check Which Package Failed

Look at build logs to see which `pip install` step failed:
- If it's spaCy â†’ Increase timeout for that specific step
- If it's PyMuPDF â†’ Same approach

### Option B: Use Alternative Dockerfile

```bash
# Switch to the more optimized version
mv Dockerfile Dockerfile.original
mv Dockerfile.optimized Dockerfile

git add Dockerfile
git commit -m "Use highly optimized Dockerfile"
git push

# Redeploy in Coolify
```

### Option C: Test Build Locally First

```powershell
# Test if Docker build works locally
docker build -t promopack-test .

# If successful locally but fails in Coolify:
# - Coolify might have stricter timeouts
# - Network might be slower
# - Consider increasing Coolify build timeout setting
```

---

## Summary

**Before:**
- Build failed during `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Network timeout downloading large packages
- No container created â†’ 502 error

**After:**
- Split package installation into groups
- Added timeouts and retries
- Better caching with separate RUN commands
- Excluded unnecessary files with `.dockerignore`

**Expected Result:**
- Build completes successfully
- Container starts properly
- Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- No more 502 errors

---

## Files Changed

âœ… `Dockerfile` - Optimized with timeouts and package splitting  
âœ… `.dockerignore` - Exclude unnecessary files  
âœ… `Dockerfile.optimized` - Alternative if needed  
âœ… `DOCKERFILE_BUILD_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation  
âœ… `healthcheck.py` - Diagnostic script (from earlier)  
âœ… `ACTION_PLAN.md` - Step-by-step guide  

**All pushed to GitHub** - Ready to redeploy! ðŸš€

---

## Next Action

**ðŸ‘‰ Go to Coolify and click "Redeploy"**

Then let me know:
- âœ… Does the build complete successfully?
- âœ… Does `/health` return 200 OK?

If yes: Problem solved! ðŸŽ‰  
If no: Share the build logs and we'll debug further.
